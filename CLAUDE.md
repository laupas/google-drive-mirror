## Project

Obsidian plugin for **two-way sync** between vault (sub)folders and Google Drive
folders. Supports **multiple sync targets** (each = one local (sub)folder ↔ one
Drive folder, with its own filters and state); one target may be a whole-vault
sync. Manual and automatic sync. Cross-platform (desktop + mobile,
`manifest.json: isDesktopOnly: false`). The only Node-only code is the OAuth
loopback server (`http`/`net` in `oauth-loopback.ts`), lazy-imported on desktop
so mobile never loads it; mobile authenticates via an `obsidian://` protocol
redirect instead. Hashing uses a pure-JS MD5 (`md5.ts`) and PKCE uses WebCrypto
(`crypto.subtle`), both available on mobile.

> 🛑 **Data-loss risk (core constraint):** The plugin deletes/overwrites on both sides.
> The most dangerous class of bugs is "deletion propagated incorrectly". The only
> protection is the local/remote flag model in the reconciler + the `scopeId` binding of
> the base. **Every change to the reconciler, state model, deletion paths, or base
> persistence MUST be covered by tests** (`npm test`). In particular, an empty/missing/
> foreign state must never lead to deletions — only to downloads/uploads. See the DANGER
> section in the README for the user's perspective.

## Build & Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # esbuild watch mode (inline sourcemap)
npm run build    # tsc -noEmit (typecheck) + esbuild production build -> main.js
```

- **Language:** **Code comments must ALWAYS be written in English** — every `//`, `/* */`,
  and JSDoc comment. Never add German (or any other non-English) comments; translate any you
  encounter. Identifiers and commit messages are English too. The only exception is the
  `src/i18n/locales/{de,fr,it}.ts` files, whose **string values** are translations by design
  (and whose comments follow the file's own language convention). Note: some internal
  `log.*` message strings are still German — that's a separate cleanup, not a comment.
- **Tests:** `npm test` (vitest, unit + integration under `test/`). The reconciler and the
  core sync logic are test-covered — always back up changes to them with tests. No lint
  setup. Verification before every commit: `npm test` **and** `npm run build`.
- **Committing:** Group **logically related changes into one commit** and keep unrelated
  changes in separate commits. Before committing, **ask the user** how they want the changes
  split/grouped into commit(s) rather than lumping everything into a single commit.
- The production build (`node esbuild.config.mjs production`) writes a complete,
  ready-to-install plugin directory to **`.build/`** (`main.js` + copied `manifest.json` +
  `styles.css`). To test, copy the contents of `.build/` to
  `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/google-drive-mirror/`, then reload the plugin.
  (`styles.css` and `manifest.json` remain the source in the repo root.)

## Architecture (src/)

Data flow: `main.ts` wires everything up → `SyncEngine` orchestrates a run →
`reconcile()` (files) + `reconcileFolders()` (folders) decide the action per path →
`GoogleDriveClient` performs API calls. The state (`SyncStateStore`) is the memory,
`SyncStatus` reports progress/log.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `main.ts` | Plugin entry point. Holds one `SyncEngine`+`SyncStateStore` PER target (`runtimes` map, rebuilt on target changes), runs targets sequentially in `runSync()`, target CRUD (`addTarget`/`removeTarget`/`updateTarget`/`setDriveFolderForTarget`/`setLocalFolderForTarget`). Commands, ribbon, vault events (debounced upload), poll timer, login. |
| `oauth.ts` | OAuth 2.0 with **PKCE** on both platforms. Desktop: **loopback flow** (Desktop app) — lazy-loads `oauth-loopback.ts` (the Node `http`/`net` server on `127.0.0.1:<port>` that catches the redirect). Mobile: **`obsidian://gdrive-auth`** redirect delivered via `registerObsidianProtocolHandler` (wired in `main.ts`) → `handleMobileRedirect()`. `effectiveClientId()` picks `settings.mobileClientId` on mobile (iOS/Android client, no secret) else `settings.clientId`. Token refresh directly against Google; `client_secret` sent only when present. |
| `oauth-loopback.ts` | Desktop-only loopback server (`awaitLoopbackAuthCode`). Statically imports Node `http`/`net`; **only** imported via dynamic `import()` from `oauth.ts`'s desktop branch, so mobile never evaluates the `require("http")`. |
| `md5.ts` | Pure-JS MD5 (`md5Hex(ArrayBuffer)`) replacing Node `crypto` — works on mobile. Output byte-identical to Node's, guarded by known-vector tests. |
| `drive-client.ts` | Google Drive REST API v3 (list/download/upload/trash/search/folder). |
| `sync-engine.ts` | Operates on ONE `SyncTarget` (+ a `siblingLocalFolders()` provider for cross-target exclusion). Collects the local state (MD5 hash), fetches the Drive state, filters, executes actions, updates the sync base. |
| `reconciler.ts` | Pure functions `reconcile()` (files → `SyncAction[]`) and `reconcileFolders()` (folders → `FolderAction[]`). Deletion only if `b.local`/`b.remote`. Tested in `test/unit/reconciler.test.ts`. |
| `storage.ts` | `PluginStorage`: reads/writes JSON files in the plugin config folder (`vault.configDir/plugins/<id>/`) via `vault.adapter`. |
| `sync-state.ts` | `SyncStateStore` — the persistent "base" (per file/folder: `local`/`remote` flags, hash/mtime, `isFolder`) in its **own per-target file** `sync-state-<targetId>.json` (filename injected via ctor; `stateFileName()`/`isStateFile()` helpers; `destroy()` deletes it). `load()`/`save()`; also holds `lastSyncMs` and a `scopeId`. |
| `sync-status.ts` | `SyncStatus`: observable live status (`phase`/`message`/`current`/`total`) + log, persisted in its **own file** `sync-log.json` with retention. Observer pattern via `subscribe()`. |
| `settings-tab.ts` | Settings UI. Renders the target list (`renderTarget` per target: name, Drive/local folder, filters, exclude-folders, delete behavior, and a per-target **sync tree** via `renderTreeNodes`/`buildTree`, per-row checkboxes, auto-refresh after sync), add/remove-target buttons, plus global OAuth/auto-sync/log sections. Also contains `SyncLogModal` (live log). The vault-folder field is hidden for "whole vault", otherwise required. |
| `suggesters.ts` | `AbstractInputSuggest` autocomplete for local and Drive folders. |
| `logger.ts` | Central `log` wrapper with prefix `[GDrive Sync]`. `info`/`debug` only when `settings.debugLogging` is active; `warn`/`error` always. Toggle via `setDebugLogging()`. |
| `types.ts` | `SyncTarget`, `newTarget()`, `PluginSettings` (holds `targets: SyncTarget[]` + global OAuth/auto-sync/log fields), `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, `SyncStateEntry`, `DriveFile`, `DriveFolder`, `SyncAction`, `FolderAction`, `OAUTH_SCOPE`. |
| `i18n/` | `index.ts`: `t(key, params?)` translation function + `detectLocale()`/`initLocale()`. `locales/{en,de,it,fr}.ts`: message dicts. See **i18n** below. |

**Tests (`test/`):** vitest, Node environment. `test/unit/` (reconciler, reconcile-folders,
sync-state, sync-status, drive-client, oauth, i18n), `test/integration/` (sync-engine),
`test/helpers/` (factories + fakes for vault/drive/storage), `test/mocks/obsidian.ts`
(slim replacement for the types-only `obsidian` package). `npm test` = `vitest run`.

## Central design decisions (not obvious from the code)

- **Auth:** Each user creates their **own Google Cloud app** (client ID/secret stored
  locally in the settings). No proxy server. On **desktop** the OAuth client type must be
  **"Desktop app"** so the loopback redirect works without a registered redirect URI.
  On **mobile** (no loopback possible) the user additionally creates an **"Android/iOS"**
  client (PKCE, no secret) with `obsidian://gdrive-auth` registered as the redirect URI,
  and enters its ID as `settings.mobileClientId` (`MOBILE_REDIRECT_URI` in `types.ts`).
  Deliberately kept user-owned + no backend + no Google verification/CASA audit — the
  price is per-platform client setup. Scope is the full **`drive`** (`OAUTH_SCOPE` in
  `types.ts`) — deliberately not `drive.file`, so that files created manually in Drive are
  also visible.
- **Shared Drives (Team Drives):** Supported. All Drive calls set `supportsAllDrives=true`
  (constant `SUPPORTS_ALL_DRIVES` in `drive-client.ts`; harmless on My Drive).
  `getFolder`/`searchFolders` return the `driveId`; if the root folder lives in a Shared
  Drive, it is stored in `settings.driveSharedId` and passed to `listFiles`, which then
  sets `corpora=drive` + `includeItemsFromAllDrives=true` + `driveId` (otherwise the list
  API doesn't find the files). Empty `driveSharedId` = My Drive.
- **Recursive sync with mirrored folder structure:** `listFiles()` descends by BFS into
  all Drive subfolders and derives `relativePath` from the folder chain (e.g.
  `sub/note.md`). This also captures subfolders/files created manually in Drive. On upload
  `createFile()` creates missing intermediate folders in Drive via `ensureFolderPath()`
  (with `folderCache` per run; `clearFolderCache()` at run start). The reconciler/engine
  maps via `relativePath` (not via the Drive-ID hierarchy). `appProperties.obsidianPath`
  (`PATH_PROP`) is still written on upload but is only a fallback now — the truth is the
  actual folder structure.
- **Multiple sync targets:** `settings.targets` is a `SyncTarget[]`. Each target has its
  own `id`, Drive folder, `localFolder`, filters (`allowedExtensions`/`ignorePatterns`/
  `excludeFolders`), `neverDeleteRemote`, and its **own sync base file** (`sync-state-<id>.
  json`). All targets share the **same OAuth account** (global `clientId`/`clientSecret`/
  `refreshToken`). `main.ts` builds one `SyncEngine`+`SyncStateStore` per target
  (`rebuildRuntimes()`) and runs them **sequentially** in `runSync()` (a shared `running`
  flag serializes; parallel targets would fight over event suppression and Drive rate
  limits). Removing a target deletes its state file (`SyncStateStore.destroy()`); orphaned
  `sync-state-*.json` of no-longer-configured targets are cleaned up on load
  (`cleanupOrphanStateFiles()`). **No migration** from the old single-target layout — the
  legacy fields are stripped from data.json on load (`stripLegacyFields`) and the user
  reconfigures targets; the reconciler's deletion safety means a fresh base never deletes.
- **Cross-target folder exclusion (`SyncTarget.excludeFolders` + `siblingLocalFolders`):**
  So a subfolder owned by one target is never mirrored into a second Drive by a whole-vault
  target, every engine excludes (a) the local folders of ALL OTHER targets and (b) the
  target's own manual `excludeFolders`. The engine combines both into a frozen
  `active.excludeFolders` per run (`computeExcludeFolders()`, sibling folders mapped to
  sync-relative) and applies `isExcluded()` on **BOTH sides** (local + Drive, files +
  folders) exactly like the ignore filter — so an excluded path is never seen as "deleted
  on one side" (deletion-safety, covered by an integration test). Also honored in
  `main.isInScope()`/`inTargetScope()` so an excluded path doesn't trigger auto-sync.
- **Scope "whole vault" vs. subfolder:** `target.localFolder === ""` means **whole
  vault**; a set path restricts to that subfolder. The "Sync entire vault" UI toggle in
  `settings-tab.ts` switches this per target. A scope change goes through
  `plugin.setLocalFolderForTarget()`, which **resets that target's sync base** on change
  (analogous to `setDriveFolderForTarget`). `vault.getFiles()` returns only vault files
  anyway (`.obsidian` is never included).
- **Only ONE whole-vault target:** two whole-vault targets would mirror the same files
  into two Drives (they can't exclude each other — neither owns a specific subfolder). So
  `setLocalFolderForTarget(id, "")` is **refused** (returns `false`) if another target is
  already whole-vault (`plugin.wholeVaultTargetId()`), and the settings UI **disables** the
  "Sync entire vault" toggle on the other targets (with a hint naming the owner), forcing
  them to pick a subfolder. A freshly added target defaults to `localFolder === ""` but
  syncs nothing until a Drive folder is set, and its toggle is locked off when a whole-vault
  target already exists.
- **System-path exclusion (`isSystemPath` in sync-engine.ts):** `.obsidian/*`, `.trash/*`,
  and `.DS_Store` are excluded on **both** sides (local collection AND remote import), so
  that a full sync doesn't include the config folder / our own state. `main.isInScope()`
  filters the same paths for the auto-sync events.
- **Trashed Drive files:** `listChildren()` already filters via the query `trashed = false`.
  A trashed file is therefore absent from `remote` and, with an existing base, treated as
  "deleted remotely" (reconciler case 7).
- **The sync base is mandatory:** The three-way comparison needs the stored base to tell
  "deleted locally" from "newly added remotely". "Reset sync state" in the settings only
  clears this base (not the files).
- **Deletion safety via `local`/`remote` flags (IMPORTANT):** Every `SyncStateEntry`
  remembers whether the file existed on the respective side at the last processing. The
  reconciler propagates a deletion ONLY if the base attests that the file was there
  (`b.local` resp. `b.remote`). If a file is missing locally but the base says it was never
  local (`local=false`) → it counts as a new addition and is **downloaded, not deleted**.
  This prevents the catastrophe "empty/copied/foreign state empties the Drive". A new entry
  after upload/download always has `local=true, remote=true` (`entryFrom`/`folderEntry` in
  `sync-engine.ts`).
- **Scope binding of the base (`scopeId`):** each `sync-state-<id>.json` stores a `scopeId`
  = `vault name :: target id :: Drive folder ID :: local folder`. If it doesn't match on
  load (e.g. the file was copied from another vault), the base is **discarded** →
  everything is reconciled fresh (download/upload), never deleted. The `target id`
  component keeps the scope unique even if two targets happen to share the same Drive/local
  folder.
- **"Do not delete in Google Drive" (`target.neverDeleteRemote`, default off):** When on,
  a local deletion is NOT propagated as `deleteRemote` but as `keepRemoteDropLocal`: the
  Drive file stays, and the base entry is set to `local=false, remote=true, keptRemoteOnly=
  true`. The `keptRemoteOnly` flag is what distinguishes "deliberately Drive-only" from a
  copied/foreign base — the reconciler must NOT download a `keptRemoteOnly` entry (Fall 3
  → noop as long as the Drive file is unchanged), whereas a plain `local=false` (copied
  base) IS downloaded (data-loss protection). The noop handler in the engine preserves a
  `keptRemoteOnly` entry (refreshing md5/remoteMtime) instead of deleting it, so the file
  doesn't reappear as a "new remote" download. **Folders too:** `reconcileFolders` also
  honors `neverDeleteRemote` — a locally deleted folder becomes `keepRemoteFolder` (kept in
  Drive, base → `keptRemoteOnly`) instead of `deleteRemoteFolder`. Without this, the Drive
  folder still holds the kept file and the `remoteSubtreeHasFiles` safety net would log a
  "folder not deleted: still contains files" error on every run.
- **Sync tree in the settings (`renderSyncTree` in settings-tab.ts):** shows the COMPLETE
  sync base as a collapsible tree (folders as `<details>`; `buildTree()` turns the flat
  paths into a nested `TreeNode` structure incl. intermediate structure-only folders).
  Every entry with a state record gets a checkbox in a right-aligned action bar
  (`renderRowActions` → `addRowAction`, the docking point for future per-row buttons):
  **checked = exists locally** (normal entries: checked + disabled, status only);
  **unchecked = `keptRemoteOnly`** (checking calls `plugin.restoreRemoteOnly(path)` → clears
  the flag → next sync downloads it, Fall 3). The tree lives in a stable container (`treeEl`)
  that `refreshTree(id)` repopulates without a full settings re-render — called on the
  status subscription when a sync finishes (`refreshAllTrees()`) and via the refresh
  button. There is **one tree per target** (`treeEls`/`treeDescSettings` keyed by target
  id); `plugin.getSyncEntries(id)` supplies a target's entries and
  `plugin.restoreRemoteOnly(id, path)` clears its keptRemoteOnly flag. `buildTree` is
  unit-tested in `test/unit/build-tree.test.ts`.
- **Folder tracking:** Folders are tracked explicitly in the state (`isFolder=true`, own
  `local`/`remote` flags). `listFiles()` returns `{ files, folders }`; `reconcileFolders()`
  mirrors the file deletion logic. Order in the engine: CREATE folders before files
  (shallow→deep), DELETE folders after files (deep→shallow). This way empty folders are
  synced and deleted too.
- **Conflict strategy:** fixed **"newer wins"** (mtime comparison in `reconciler.ts`). But:
  a **deletion always loses against an edit** on the other side (cases 6/7), to avoid data
  loss.
- **Deletions → trash**, never hard: Drive via `trashFile` (`trashed: true`), locally via
  `vault.trash(file, false)` resp. `adapter.trashLocal(path)` — Obsidian's **`.trash`
  folder in the vault** (not the system trash), so deleted files remain recoverable inside
  the vault. Applies to files AND folders.
- **Filter (`extensionAllowed` + `isGoogleAppsFile` in `sync-engine.ts`):** Google Editors
  files (`application/vnd.google-apps.*` → Docs/Sheets/Slides/folders) are **always**
  skipped, since they aren't downloadable as binary files (otherwise 403
  `fileNotDownloadable`). Additionally an optional file-extension whitelist filter
  (`target.allowedExtensions`, comma-separated, empty = all). Both filters apply to
  **local AND Drive side**, so the reconciler doesn't misinterpret a filtered file as
  "deleted on one side".
- **Ignore filter (`target.ignorePatterns` + `src/ignore.ts`):** Blacklist complementary
  to `allowedExtensions`. Comma-separated patterns; supports plain extensions (`tmp`,
  `.log`), exact filenames (`.DS_Store`), and glob patterns (`*.tmp`, `drafts/*`,
  `**/node_modules/**` — `*`/`?` don't cross `/`, `**` does). Patterns without `/` match the
  filename at any depth; with `/` they anchor to the full sync-relative path. Pure functions
  `parseIgnorePatterns()`/`isIgnored()` are unit-tested in `test/unit/ignore.test.ts`. Like
  the extension filter it applies to **both sides** (files AND folders) — an ignored file
  must never look "deleted on one side" (deletion-safety, covered by an integration test).
  Also honored in `main.isInScope()` so an ignored path doesn't trigger auto-sync. Patterns
  are matched against the **sync-relative** path (folder prefix stripped).
- **i18n (`src/i18n/`):** All user-facing strings go through `t(key, params?)`. Supported
  locales: **en (default & fallback), de, it, fr**. The active language follows Obsidian's
  UI language automatically — `detectLocale()` reads `window.localStorage["language"]`
  defensively (any error / no `window` → `"en"`, so the Node tests work), and `initLocale()`
  is called once in `main.onload()`. `en.ts` is the **authoritative key set** (`Messages`
  type); the other locales are `Partial<Messages>` and fall back to en per missing key.
  Placeholders use `{name}` interpolation (NOT template literals in the dicts). Emoji/symbol
  prefixes (`↑ ↓ 🗑 ⚔ 📁 …`) stay in the CODE, not the strings, so they're consistent across
  languages. **Rule: every new user-facing string must get a key in all four locales** —
  `test/unit/i18n.test.ts` enforces key completeness + placeholder preservation, so a missing
  translation or a dropped `{path}` fails the tests. Internal `log.*` messages stay English.
  **Log caveat:** `sync-log.json` stores already-rendered text, so historical log entries keep
  the language they were written in; only new entries use the active locale.
  **Watch out** in `settings-tab.ts`: `.addText/.addToggle` callbacks name the component `c`
  (not `t`) so they don't shadow the imported `t()` translation function.

## Persistence split (important)

Files in the plugin folder (`.obsidian/plugins/google-drive-mirror/`):
- **`data.json`** — only the `PluginSettings` (global credentials, the `targets` array with
  each target's folders/filters, auto-sync/retention options). Via `loadData()`/`saveData()`.
- **`sync-state-<targetId>.json`** — the sync base of ONE target (per file/folder:
  `local`/`remote` flags, hash/mtime, `isFolder`, `driveId`) + `lastSyncMs` + `scopeId`.
  Via `SyncStateStore` (filename injected) + `PluginStorage`. Rewritten on every sync of
  that target; grows with the number of files — hence deliberately NOT in data.json. If the
  `scopeId` doesn't match on load (file copied from another vault), that target's base is
  discarded. Orphaned files of removed targets are deleted on load
  (`cleanupOrphanStateFiles()`); removing a target deletes its file (`destroy()`).
- **`sync-log.json`** — the (shared) sync log. Via `SyncStatus` + `PluginStorage`, saved
  debounced, with retention (`settings.logRetentionHours`, default 24h, 0 = never).

Global settings fields: `clientId`/`clientSecret`/`refreshToken`, `debugLogging`,
`logRetentionHours`, auto-sync options. Per-target fields (filters, folders,
`neverDeleteRemote`) live on each `SyncTarget`. **No** bulk-deletion threshold — deletion
safety sits entirely in the reconciler (local/remote flags).

**No migration** from the pre-multi-target layout: `loadSettings()` strips the legacy
single-target fields (`driveFolderId`/`localFolder`/`allowedExtensions`/…) and the old
`syncState`/`lastSyncMs` from data.json (`stripLegacyFields`), so they aren't written back.
The user reconfigures targets; the reconciler's deletion safety means a fresh base only
downloads/uploads, never deletes. `lastSyncMs` lives per-target in each state store;
`plugin.getLastSyncMs()` returns the max across targets.

## Status & log (sync-status.ts)

- The engine gets a `SyncStatus` instance injected and reports progress: `start()` →
  `update(msg, current, total)` per action → `finish("done"|"error", msg)`. Only "real"
  actions (not `noop`) count towards progress.
- `main.ts` shows the status in a **status-bar item** (clickable → sync) and subscribes via
  `status.subscribe()`. During a run a 1s `setInterval` calls `status.touch()`, so the
  elapsed duration updates even without new events.
- `settings-tab.ts` shows a live status line and **disables the sync button** during a run
  (`refreshSyncButton()`). The subscription is released in `hide()` and at the start of
  `display()` (no leak).
- **`SyncLogModal`** (in `settings-tab.ts`): its own modal, opened via the "Show log"
  button, shows the full log and updates **live** (own `status.subscribe()`, unsubscribed
  in `onClose()`). Newest entries on top.
- `runSync()` in `main.ts` bails out early if a sync is already running
  (`engine.isRunning()`), and starts the button click via `void` (not awaited), so the live
  status stays visible.

## Auto-sync triggers (main.ts)

- **Local change:** vault events (`modify`/`create`/`delete`/`rename`) → debounced
  (`localDebounceMs`) → `runSync(false)`.
- **Remote:** `setInterval` every `pollIntervalSeconds` (min. 15) → `runSync(false)`.
- **Event suppression:** While the engine itself writes files, the vault events this
  triggers are ignored via `suppressedPaths`, to prevent sync loops. Coarse strategy:
  suppress all scope paths during the run, release again ~1.5s after the run.

## HTTP / API conventions

- All Google calls go through Obsidian's `requestUrl` (not `fetch`), to work around
  CORS/network restrictions. Always `throw: false` + manual status check (`assertOk` in the
  Drive client).
- Uploads: **multipart/related** (metadata + content in a single request), no resumable
  upload.
- **Retry + backoff (drive-client.ts):** all Drive calls go through a central `request()`
  wrapper that retries TRANSIENT failures (429 rate limit, 5xx, network exceptions) with
  exponential backoff + jitter (`MAX_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BASE_MS`). Deterministic 4xx (except
  429) are not retried. `requestImpl` is constructor-injectable so tests can drive the retry
  logic without real sleeps (`test/unit/drive-client.test.ts`).

## Performance (large vaults)

- **Local hash cache (`collectLocal`):** instead of reading + MD5-hashing every file on
  every run, the stored MD5 from the base is reused when **mtime AND size** are unchanged
  (rsync/Syncthing principle). Only changed/new files (or a size/mtime mismatch) are read.
  On the second and every later sync almost nothing is hashed. False-positive (cache hit
  despite a change) is excluded because a real edit always changes mtime; a mismatch just
  falls back to hashing (never wrong, only slower).
- **Parallel file transfers (`runPool`, sync-engine.ts):** the real file actions run through
  a bounded-concurrency pool (`MAX_CONCURRENCY`, 6). File transfers are independent (distinct
  paths → distinct state keys), so parallel I/O is safe. `noop` actions run sequentially
  first (state-only). Folder phases stay serial and keep their order: CREATE folders before
  files, DELETE folders after files. `runPool` is exported + unit-tested
  (`test/unit/run-pool.test.ts`).
- **Parallel-safe folder cache (drive-client.ts):** `resolveFolderPath` caches the in-flight
  PROMISE per accumulated path (not just the finished ID). Two concurrent uploads needing the
  same not-yet-created folder await the same promise instead of both creating a duplicate
  Drive folder. On failure the cache entry is dropped so a later run can retry.
  `ensureParentDir` (local) tolerates a concurrent mkdir race.

## Interruption robustness / checkpoints (sync-engine.ts)

- The state is checkpointed **during** a run every `CHECKPOINT_EVERY` (50) executed file
  actions (`checkpoint()` → `state.save()`) and once finally at run end (then additionally
  with `lastSyncMs`). On interruption (app closed / crash) a large run therefore costs at
  most the last ~50 actions, not the whole progress.
- **Why not after every file:** `state.save()` writes the ENTIRE `sync-state.json` every
  time (no append). With N files, "every file" would be O(n²) write volume + N synchronous
  `JSON.stringify` blockings of the main thread. Batching by 50 is the compromise.
- A checkpoint contains only entries of **completed** transfers (`local=true, remote=true`)
  and is therefore always a consistent partial state. `checkpoint()` deliberately does NOT
  set `lastSyncMs` (a run only counts as finished at the end) and swallows write errors
  (log only), so a failed checkpoint doesn't abort the sync.
- **Preparation phase after an interruption:** `collectLocal()` runs again, but thanks to
  the mtime+size hash cache it only re-reads files that actually changed — unchanged files
  reuse their stored MD5 (fast). Already transferred files are recognized as `noop` via MD5
  comparison (no double upload).

## Debugging

- Central logger `log` (`logger.ts`) with prefix **`[GDrive Sync]`**. `log.warn`/
  `log.error` are always visible; `log.info`/`log.debug` **only** when "Debug logging"
  (`settings.debugLogging`) is active in the settings — Obsidian guideline: console free of
  non-errors by default. Initialized in `onload()` with `setDebugLogging()`, toggle in the
  settings tab. Do not use `console.log` directly in `src/`.
- Sync errors are additionally shown in a notice (first 3 verbatim, rest counted) and
  written to the persistent sync log (visible in the "Show log" modal). Open the console:
  `Cmd+Option+I`.

## Known limitations / to-dos

- **Renames** = delete + re-create (no rename tracking via the Drive ID).
- No **resumable upload** for large files.
- No **Drive Changes API** (`changes.list`); Drive is polled via a full listing.
- Conflict strategy not configurable (no "keep both").
