   *
   * The pure `reconcile()` is reused UNCHANGED — it is called per batch over a

   * independent (it only reads local/remote/base for that one path), calling it
   * per subset yields exactly the same actions as one whole-set call.
   *
   * DELETION SAFETY: two phases.
   *  - Phase 1 (remote-present): stream the store in batches. For each batch,
   *    reconcile the batch paths (their local + base + the batch remote) and
   *    execute. These are additions/updates/noops/conflicts — never a deletion
   *    of some OTHER path. Record every remote path in `seen`.
   *  - Phase 2 (remote-absent): only AFTER the full remote set has been seen,
   *    reconcile the paths in (local ∪ base) that are NOT in `seen`, with an
   *    EMPTY remote for them. This is where local-only uploads and
   *    remote-deletion (deleteLocal) are decided — safely, because we now know
   *    the complete remote set. Running deletions before the full scan would
   *    mass-delete, hence the strict ordering.
   *
   * The per-run cap (mobile batch limit) counts executed real actions; when hit
